# Caracal
Ring polymer molecular dynamics and rate constant calculations on black-box potential energy surfaces

## About Caracal

Caracal is a free open-source software package that enables a wide variety of molecular dynamics applications.
Unbiased and biased molecular dynamics trajectories can be sampled, unperiodic as well as periodic (NVE, NVT, NpT) setups are possible.

Classical (Newtonian) as well as ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) can be used.
A central feature is the automized setup of potential energy surfaces for gas phase reactions using the EVB-QMDFF methodology.

Quantum mechanical derived force fields (QMDFFs) can be generated in black box fashion for arbitrary chemical systems, two QMDFFs can be coupled by
different EVB (Empirical Valence Bond) coupling methods.

Simple energy difference coupling methods as well as more sophisticated methods like distributed gaussian (DG)-EVB or transition region corrected reaction path EVB-QMDFF (TREQ) are availabe for that purpose.

Especially the TREQ method allows for black-box generation of high quality PES descriptions, the whole process of PES setup and rate constant calculation with RPMD is realized in the black-box program within Caracal.

The well-known class of semiempirical GFN-xTB methods is implemented now as well, enabling the black-box simulation of arbitrary chemical systems.

QMDFFs of single molecules can be polymerized to describe complex multicomponent mixtures or solutions, containing molecules like transition metal complexes for which it is hard to get force field parametrizations but are easy to setup with QMDFF.

Further, a steadily growing number of analytical PES representations of gas phase reaction systems from the literature is integrated into Caracal, mainly for the calculation of rate constants. Alternatively, you can couple your own
PES routine to the program (either by defining a syscall or directly integrating the subroutine into the Caracal code) and perform biased or unbiased RPMD with it.

If you use Caracal for your research, I would be very glad if you could cite the ***original Caracal paper*** ([DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00568](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00568)). 
Within it and its supporting information, more details concerning the underlying theory and algorithms can be found as well.

## Obtaining Caracal

The program package can be obtained by getting a copy of this repository using git:
```
git clone git://github.com/Trebonius91/CARACAL.git
```
## Installation:

Caracal is written in Fortran 90, with some minor parts in Fortran 77.
For compilation, the following dependencies are required:

- Standard Fortran 90 compiler (gfortran, ifort, etc.)
- Lapack and BLAS
- FFTW
- MPI

## Compiling from Source

The Makefile, which is located in the main directory, should be modified to meet your system requirements, choosing a suitable set of compiler and required libraries
(a separate configure file will be added in the future). 
Since Caracal now includes an API to call machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) energies+gradients from ASE, up to date Fortran and C compilers need to be present, as well as a recent Python version. 
If the latter differs too much from the first, broken dependencies can occur during linking.

After, this, copy it to the src directory and run
```
$ make
```
Currently, parallel make (-jN) is not recommended since problems with nested Fortran modules might arise.
If the build is successful, the different programs of the package are located in the bin directory.

If you want to use pGFN-FF as a PES description, the GULP program must be included as a patch. See [pGFN-FF with GULP](https://github.com/Trebonius91/CARACAL/wiki/dynamic#example-4-hh2-with-external-program) for how GULP can be obtained and the Caracal patch can be done.

## Executing the programs

In order to understand the handling of the different programs in Caracal, type the help option, e.g.
```
$ dynamic.x -h
```
Now, general instructions how to use the program as well as a list of available keywords is shown.

## Tutorials and Examples

A detailed set of tutorials describing the different programs, including a set of different examples covering relevant application cases can be found in the [Caracal Wiki](https://github.com/Trebonius91/CARACAL/wiki)

## Further Questions, Suggestions or Bug Reports
